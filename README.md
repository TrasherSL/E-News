Overview
The E-News App is a simple and user-friendly mobile application developed using Flutter, designed to fetch and display real-time news articles from various categories like general, business, entertainment, health, science, sports, and technology. Users can search for specific news articles, bookmark their favorites, and manage them through a dedicated bookmarks section.

The app utilizes a news API to fetch the latest news articles and provides a smooth experience through efficient state management, custom UI components, and integration with third-party libraries.
